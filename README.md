This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

# Quick Saver Native App

In an effort to both save my money and learn React-Native, I decided to create an app to do just that.

### How to test

Clone this repo and run `yarn` inside of the folder to install dependencies. While that is installing, go download the [Expo App](https://expo.io/) for your phone. After installation you should be able to run `yarn start` which will create a QR code you can scan, or URL you can visit inside of the [Expo App](https://expo.io/) that will compile the application and run it on your device.
